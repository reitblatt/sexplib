Description: support library for contains functionality for parsing and pretty-printing S-expressions in OCaml
             The sexp library contains functionality for parsing and
             pretty-printing S-expressions. In addition to that it contains a
             preprocessing module for Camlp4 which can be used to automatically
             generate code from type definitions for efficiently converting
             OCaml-values to S-expressions and vice versa.
